Booking a Table on the Little Lemon Website Capstone
This repository contains the final project I wrote while pursuing the Meta Professional Front End Dev Certificate in the section Front End Dev Capstone. The project is about booking a table on the Little Lemon website, and it serves as my final exam for the course.

About the Project
The project is a front-end web application that allows users to book a table on the Little Lemon website. It is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. The application features a user-friendly interface that allows users to select a date and time, the number of guests, and their contact details.

Getting Started
To get started with the project, you need to have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You also need to have a code editor installed on your computer, such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text.

To run the application, simply download or clone the repository to your local machine, and open the index.html file in your browser. You can then start booking a table by selecting the date and time, the number of guests, and your contact details.
